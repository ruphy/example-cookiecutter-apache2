# Contributing to apitool

First of all, welcome! We're happy you want to contribute to this project!

This project follows a simple "trunk-based development" workflow, in other words you should follow the usual fork-edit-PR dance:

- Fork this repository
- Commit your modifications (rebase/squash as necessary)
- (optional) explicitly add yourself to the list of authors - use the `.reuse/dep5` file -- note you would still retain any copyright to the code with or without this step
- Submit a "Pull Request" to the main GitHub repository
- Discuss it with the team, if needed
- Experience your heart fill with joy at the sight of the "merged" badge
- Celebrate, rest, repeat!

Please note we have a code of conduct, do follow it in all your interactions with the project.
